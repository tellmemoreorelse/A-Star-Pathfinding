# A-Star-Pathfinding
My take on making an A* Pathfinding algorithm using the JavaFX library to draw to the screen and handle user input.


Hold s and click to place the starting point
Hold f and click to place the finish point

Click and drag to draw the walls

Hold e and click/drag to erase

Click m to generate a random maze. Your starting point is automatically placed in the top left and your finish point is placed in the bottom right.

Hit space to start the algorithm. The purple is the shortest path, and the red is everywhere the algorithm checked.
